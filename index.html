    <h3>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</h3>
    <p>Introducing Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. Designed with a unique contour-cut camera
      to create a revolution in photography — letting you capture cinematic 8K
      video and snap epic stills, all in one go. And with Galaxy's fastest chipset,
      strongest glass, 5G and an all-day battery, Ultra easily lives up to its
      name.

    <h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</h3>
    <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (stylized and marketed
      as Samsung Galaxy Note20 and Galaxy Note20 Ultra) are Android-based phablets
      designed, developed, produced, and marketed by Samsung Electronics for their Samsung
      Galaxy Note series, succeeding the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 series</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Samsung Galaxy S21 Plusa</h3>
    <p>The Galaxy S21 Plus is a superb phone on its own merits, but it offers little
      that you don't get with the regular, and cheaper, Galaxy S21, apart from
      its larger screen. But if screen size is a deal-breaker for you, and you're
      happy to pay a bit more for the extra real estate, then you'll be plenty
      satisfied with the middle sibling in the S21 family.</p>

    <h2>Xiaomi</h2>
    <p>we have three best type from Xiaomi</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra</h3>
    <p>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is a potentially great phone that’s ruined by what Xiaomi
      is pitching as its standout feature: the giant camera bump makes the phone
      unwieldy, and not only does the rear display not bring any important features,
      we also found it got in the way frequently. It’s hard to make a case for
      a phone with this annoying ‘extra’, especially given the high asking price.
      It’s a shame, because buried beneath that mountainous bump is a great phone
      with fantastic cameras, a powerful processor and a good-looking screen.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Xiaomi Poco F3 </h3>
    <p>Xiaomi Poco F3 - powerful beast, eight-core Snapdragon 870 (approx. 630,000
      AnTuTu score), 6.67" AMOLED display, refresh rate 120Hz, 6GB RAM LPDDR5,
      Triple Camera 48MPx, battery 4520mAh, support 33W fast charging, NFC, Google
      Pay, Dual SIM slot, 5G and WiFi 6 support and much more</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Xiaomi Mi Mix Fold</h3>
    <p>Xiaomi Mi MIX is an Android Smartphone manufactured by Xiaomi. It is designed
      by Philippe Starck, and awarded multiple top design awards for product design.
      It has been taken by multiple museum around the world as design collection,
      including Centre Pompidou in Paris and Design Museum. It is the world's 1st
      3 border bezel-less phone category. It was succeeded by the Xiaomi Mi MIX
      2 in September 2017, followed by the Xiaomi Mi MIX 3 on 25 October 2018 and
      the latest Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 on 10 August 2021.</p>
